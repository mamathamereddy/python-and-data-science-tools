# Week 3 : Basic Life cycle of ML model


## Pre-requisites:
Basic Python as introduced in Weeks 1 and 2

## Lesson Plan:

### 1.Data cleaning
### 2.Splitting the dataset into training/test dataset
### 3.Create a model
### 4.Train a model
### 5.Make predictions
### 6.Evaluate and improve
#### Example: Spam classification/prediction system
* We build a logistic regression model for spam classification of text messages (see Almeida et al., Contributions to the Study of SMS Spam Filtering: New Collection and Results, and data is at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection).
* Understand the data, what differences would we expect there to be between spam and not-spam messages?
* Feature engineering

    i. Intuitive features, what can we think of?    
    ii.TF-IDF features in Python
* Training and evaluation

    i. Data splitting
    ii.Measures of predictive performance
