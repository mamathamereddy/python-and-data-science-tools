# Preparation
- We'll make a small experiment to generate data for this week. Fill in the Google form at https://forms.gle/eHnq2rRRBSuZfFjg9 (the form does not ask for personal data and you do not need to log in to a Google account to answer it).
- Download the Jupyter notebook Week3.ipynb and make sure it runs on your computer (you do not need to read it - just install the dependencies, download data, and change paths to make it run. Note that there are some TASKs in the notebook - we'll do these during the Sunday session and they are not part of the preparation). It uses two data sets (responses.csv and SMSSpamCollection.txt) - they can both be downloaded from github.
