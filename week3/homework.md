## Homework exercises for Week #3

The exercises this week wrap up the tasks in the Week 3 Jupyter notebook. For all the exercises, remember to comment your code.

### Mandatory
- Task 1: Clean the data. Make summaries and plots of the data (there are many options - just make a couple of summaries and a couple of plots).
- Investigate if the participants in the sudoku experiment were faster doing the Latin letter or the Greek letter sudoku using the techniques in the Jupyter notebook (model-based, or using visualizations and summaries).

### Optional
- Task 2: solve Task 2.
- Task 3: solve Task 3 (again, there are many options - try out some of them).
