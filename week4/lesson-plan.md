# Week 4 : Building your own model

This week, we build an ML predictive model for Co2 emission based on engine size using Linear regression. 

## Pre-requisites:
Dataset and notebooks can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles?select=Data+Description.csv). 

## Lesson Plan:
### 1.	Introduction about Linear regression. 
### 2.	Steps for Predictive Co2 emission of vehicle based on Engine in Python
 
* Step 1. Import required libraries 
* Step 2. Read the CSV file
* Step 3.  Select the features we want to consider in predicting values:
* Step 4. Plot the data
* Step 5. Divide the data into training and testing data
* Step 6. Training our model
* Step 7.  Plot the best fit line
* Step 8.  Prediction function
* Step 9. Predicting co2 emissions
* Step 10. Checking accuracy for test data
