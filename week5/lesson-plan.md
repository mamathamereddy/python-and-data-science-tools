# Week 5 : Follow-up on last week’s work and ML Tree structure

## Pre-requisites:
No pre-requisites

## Lesson Plan:
### 1. Discussion about last week’s assignment. Walk-through of parts of the work.
### 2. Machine learning methods are traditionally divided into three categories (though one should not think of this as an exact classification).

#### 1.	Supervised learning
* Data contains example inputs and outputs (e.g., a prediction problem). The task is to learn a map from input to output.
#### 2.	Unsupervised learning
* No labels (or outputs) are given and the goal is to find some structure in the data.
* Clustering example.
* This can be used for feature engineering.
#### 3.	Reinforcement learning
* A program interacts with an environment and receives rewards (feedback) which is used to optimize behavior.
* Tic-tac-toe example.
